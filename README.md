# Parallel algorithm Benchmark Suite

This is the benchmark suite of IPS⁴o presented in the paper [In-place Parallel Super Scalar Samplesort (IPS⁴o)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02257) (todo update link).
The benchmark suite compares our algorithms IPS⁴o [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/ips4o/ips4o), In-place Parallel Super Scalar Radix Sort (IPS²Ra) [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/ips4o/ips2ra), and Parallel Super Scalar Samplesort (PS⁴o) [(GitHub link)](https://github.com/ips4o/ps4o), to various sequential and parallel radix as well as comparison based sorting algorithms.
Here's the abstract:

## TODO

- [ ] Add Generator
    - [X] Implement graph generator (completed on 5/5/2025)
    - [ ] Implement database generator
- [X] Add a way of detecting memory usage (completed on 5/7/2025)
- [ ] Extend the `run.sh`
- [ ] Add interface for faster module selection


(todo update)
> We present a sorting algorithm that works in-place, executes in parallel, is
> cache-efficient, avoids branch-mispredictions, and performs work O(n log n) for
> arbitrary inputs with high probability. The main algorithmic contributions are
> new ways to make distribution-based algorithms in-place: On the practical side,
> by using coarse-grained block-based permutations, and on the theoretical side,
> we show how to eliminate the recursion stack. Extensive experiments show that
> our algorithm IPS⁴o scales well on a variety of multi-core machines. We
> outperform our closest in-place competitor by a factor of up to 3. Even as
> a sequential algorithm, we are up to 1.5 times faster than the closest
> sequential competitor, BlockQuicksort.

## Results

You compile the figures used in our publication by invoking the script `benchmark/compile_figures.sh`.
This command compiles LaTeX files stored in the folders [benchmark/distributions](benchmark/distributions) and [benchmark/running_times](benchmark/running_times).
After compilation, take a look at the generated PDF files.

The measurements are stored in [benchmark/running_times/results.7z](benchmark/running_times/results.7z).
To reinsert the results into the LaTeX files in [benchmark/running_timers](benchmark/running_timers), you have to decompress the measurements and analyze these using the data series processing tool [SqlPlotTools](https://github.com/ips4o/sqlplot-tools.git) published by [Timo Bingmann](https://algo2.iti.kit.edu/bingmann.php).
To do so, just call the script [benchmark/analyze_data.sh](benchmark/analyze_data.sh).
The script requires an installation of the SqlPlotTools connected to a PostgreSQL database and the file archiver 7-Zip.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/ips4o/ips4o-benchmark-suite.git
cd ips4o-benchmark-suite
git submodule update --recursive --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all 
# make benchmark_ips4o benchmark_ips4ooldparallel benchmark_ips4oparallel benchmark_ips2ra benchmark_ips2raparallel
```

The executables `benchmark_ips4o` and `benchmark_ips4oparallel` execute the sequential/parallel version of IPS⁴o.
The executables `benchmark_ips2ra` and `benchmark_ips2raparallel` execute the sequential/parallel version of IPS²Ra.
For the usage of the benchmarks, we refer to the help function, e.g., `./benchmark_ips4o --help`.
Besides IPS⁴o and IPS²Ra, the benchmark suite contains many more sorting algorithms.
The benchmark `benchmark_ippradixsort` is disabled by default as it requires an installation of the [Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/integrated-performance-primitives.html).
If you have installed IPP, you may enable the CMake property `IPPRADIXSORT`, e.g., via `ccmake`.
Some sorting algorithms require a compiler supporting the Cilk Plus C++ language extension.
Thus, make sure that your compiler supports Cilk Plus out of the box or add your own Cilk Plus library to the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file.
The sorting algorithms are loaded as submodules into the folder [extern](extern).
The file [authors](authors) lists the authors of the source code used in this benchmark suite.
Additionally, the file specifies for each submodule the url, authors, and license.

## Reproducablity

The benchmarks have been executed on four machines.
On each machine, the benchmarks have been executed with

```
git clone https://github.com/ips4o/ips4o-benchmark-suite.git
cd ips4o-benchmark-suite
git submodule update --recursive --init
cd ./benchmark/running_times
./run.sh <machine-name>
```

in the folder [benchmark/running_times](benchmark/running_times).
After the benchmarks were executed, we analyzed the measurements with the script [benchmark/analyze_data.sh](benchmark/analyze_data.sh).
The script loads the measurements into a database and inserts the results into LaTeX files stored in the folder [benchmark/running_times](benchmark/running_times).
The script requires an installation of the [SqlPlotTools](https://github.com/ips4o/sqlplot-tools.git) published by [Timo Bingmann](https://algo2.iti.kit.edu/bingmann.php) connected to a PostgreSQL database and the file archiver 7-Zip.
The script expects the machine names `i10pc132`, `i10pc133`, `i10pc135`, and `i10pc136`.
The LaTeX files are included unmodified in the paper [In-place Parallel Super Scalar Samplesort (IPS⁴o)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02257).
You may create PDF files for the figures of the paper by compiling the `*_plot.tex` files in [benchmark/running_times](benchmark/running_times) with `pdflatex` or by invoking the script [benchmarks/compile_figures.sh](benchmarks/compile_figures.sh).

For the `run.sh` command, you need an installation of the [Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/integrated-performance-primitives.html) as well as Cilk Plus.
For Cilk Plus, you require a compiler supporting the Cilk Plus C++ language extension or you need provide your own Cilk Plus library which you add to the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file.
